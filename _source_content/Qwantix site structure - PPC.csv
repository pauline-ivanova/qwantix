2,How does Paid Search advertising differ from other forms of online advertising?,79,12,H3,,,,,,,,,
,"Unlike traditional advertising methods, PPC allows for precise targeting based on keywords, demographics, and user behavior.

7,"What is Quality Score, and why is it important in Pay-Per-Click Marketing",73,12,H3,,,,,,,,,
